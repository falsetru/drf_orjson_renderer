Django Rest Framework ORJSON Renderer
=====================================

`drf_orjson_renderer` is JSON renderer and parser for Django Rest Framework 
using the [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) library. Backed by 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), orjson is safe, correct and _fast_. ⚡️

In addition, unlike some performance optimized DRF renderers, It also renders
pretty printed JSON when requests are made via RestFramework's BrowsableAPI. 

You get:
- The safety of Rust
- The speed of orjson when requests are made with `Accept: appliation/json` HTTP
  header or when requests are made with an unspecified `Accept` header.
- The convenience of formatted output when requested with `Accept: text/html`.
- The ability to pass your own `default` function definition. 
 

## Installation

`pip install drf_orjson_renderer`

You can then set the `ORJSONRenderer` class as your default renderer in your `settings.py`

```Python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES": (
        "drf_orjson_renderer.renderers.ORJSONRenderer",
        "rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer",
    ),
}
```

Also you can set the `ORJSONParser` class as your default parser in your `settings.py`

```Python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES": (
        "drf_orjson_renderer.parsers.ORJSONParser",
    ),
}
```

## Passing Your Own `default` Function

By default, the `ORJSONRenderer` will pass a `default` function as a helper for
serializing objects that orjson doesn't recognize. That should cover the most 
common cases found in a Django web application. If you find you have an object 
it doesn't recognize you can pass your own default function by overriding the 
`get_renderer_context()` method of your view:

```Python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response


class MyView(APIView):
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, MyComplexData):
            return dict(obj)

    def get_renderer_context(self):
        renderer_context = super().get_renderer_context()
        renderer_context["default_function"] = self.default
        return renderer_context
    
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        my_complex_data = MyComplexData()
        return Response(data=my_complex_data)
```

If you know your data is already in a format orjson natively 
[recognizes](https://github.com/ijl/orjson/#types) you can get a small 
performance boost by passing `None` to the `renderer_context`:

```Python
def get_renderer_context(self):
    renderer_context = super().get_renderer_context()
    renderer_context["default_function"] = None
    return renderer_context
```
